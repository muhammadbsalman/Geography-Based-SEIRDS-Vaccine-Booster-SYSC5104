## GIS DEVS Web Viewer
This folder contains the files necesscary to view simulation results in the GIS DEVS Web Viewer v2 (1.3)
The web viewer is located at : http://206.12.94.204:8080/arslab-web/1.3/app-gis-v2/index.html

The GIS Web viewer requires 4 files: any_name.geojson, messages.log, structure.json, visualization.json
- A geojson representing the geographical area used to generate the model input json (ottawaDA.geojson). It may have any name.
- A message log of the simulation in standard web viewer format, generated by message log parser called messages.log
- A structure file generated by the message log parser called structure.json
- A visualization file that describes the colors and states variables to be visualized, called visualization.json

Some documentation on the visualization file exists, but features have since been added:
https://github.com/romancardenas/Group_E_Simulation_Lifecycle/wiki/3.-User-Documentation:-How-to-Use#visualization
- note the entry in the visualization file["layers"]["file"] should match the name of the geojson uploaded

This directory contains:
- example : a lightweight simulation to test viewing
- ontario : holds the visualization.json, geojson, and simulation results for Ontario PHU simulations
- ottawa : holds the visualization.json, geojson, and simulation results for Ontario DA simulations
- settings - contains the visualization colors used. These files are to assist in modifying the visualization color scheme. These changes must be made manually to visualization.json
