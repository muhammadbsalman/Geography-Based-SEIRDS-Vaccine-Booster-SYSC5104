Dissemination Area
---
A dissemination area (DA) is a small, relatively stable geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks with
an average population of 400 to 700 persons based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. It is the smallest standard
geographic area for which all census data are disseminated. DAs cover all the territory of Canada.

Dissemination Block
---
A dissemination block (DB) is an area bounded on all sides by roads and/or boundaries of standard geographic areas. The dissemination
block is the smallest geographic area for which population and dwelling counts are disseminated. Dissemination blocks cover all the
territory of Canada.
